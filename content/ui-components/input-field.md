## Accessibility

Screen readers will have trouble with your forms if you don’t include a label for every input. For these input groups, ensure that any additional label or functionality is conveyed to assistive technologies.
 
The exact technique to be used and what additional information will need to be conveyed will vary depending on the exact type of interface widget you’re implementing. The examples in this section provide a few suggested, case-specific approaches.
